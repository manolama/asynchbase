Configuration
-------------

AsyncHBase 1.7 has a new configuration class ``Config`` that enables tweaking many parameters of the client. For backwards compatibility, the existing ``HBaseClient`` constructors will instantiate a new config object with default values. However new constructors will accept a config object.

To create a config with default values, instantiate it via ``Config config = new Config();``. Or to load properties from a file, call ``Config config = new Config(<path_to_file>);`` where the file is a standard Java properties file with entries like ``hbase.rpc.timeout = 60000`` separated by new lines.

To modify the (default or parsed from file) value of a configuration entry, simply call ``config.overrideConfig(<property>, <value>);``. Make sure to modify values *before* passing the config to the ``HBaseClient`` constructor. Modifying values of the config after instantiating the client will not cause an effect as many values are read from the config and stored in the client's memory, never to be read again.

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

The following is a table of configuration options for AsyncHBase. Some of the values share names in common with HBase's configs but may behave slightly differently. Be sure to read the notes associated with the config before proceeding.

.. NOTE::

  For authentication with Kerberos, a JAAS file must be created and passed to the JVM using AsyncHBase in the system parameter ``java.security.auth.login.config``.

Data Types
^^^^^^^^^^

Some configuration values require special consideration:

* Booleans - The following literals will parse to ``True``:

  * ``1``
  * ``true``
  * ``yes``
  
  Any other values will result in a ``False``. Parsing is case insensitive
  
* Strings - Strings, even those with spaces, do not require quotation marks, but some considerations apply:

  * Special characters must be escaped with a backslash include: ``#``, ``!``, ``=``, and ``:``
    E.g.::
    
      my.property = Hello World\!
      
  * Unicode characters must be escaped with their hexadecimal representation, e.g.::
  
      my.property = \u0009
